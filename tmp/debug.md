Mismatches like you’re seeing almost always mean that the weights you’re pulling off disk don’t line up exactly with the model architecture you instantiated. Here’s a systematic way to debug and fix:

⸻

1. Confirm you’re loading the right model class + checkpoint
	•	Detector

from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("TrustSafeAI/RADAR-Vicuna-7B")

This is a RoBERTa‐large base (hidden_size=1024) with a 2-way head. If you point it at anything else—say, your Vicuna generator weights—you’ll get a 1024↔4096 mismatch.

	•	Generator

from transformers import LlamaForCausalLM
gen = LlamaForCausalLM.from_pretrained("/path/to/vicuna_7b_checkpoint", torch_dtype=torch.float16, device_map="auto")

Vicuna‐7B is a LLaMA fork (hidden_size=4096). Make sure you use LlamaForCausalLM (or AutoModelForCausalLM) and its own config.json and tokenizer.

If those two load cleanly in a REPL, then you know you haven’t mixed them up.

⸻

2. Inspect the checkpoint’s keys & shapes

Dump what you actually have on disk:

import torch
ckpt = torch.load("/path/to/pytorch_model.bin", map_location="cpu")
for k, v in ckpt.items():
    print(k, v.shape)

Compare to the model you instantiated:

model = YourModelClass.from_pretrained("/path/to", local_files_only=True)
for k, v in model.state_dict().items():
    if k in ckpt and ckpt[k].shape != v.shape:
        print("MISMATCH", k, "ckpt:", ckpt[k].shape, "model:", v.shape)

That will pinpoint exactly which layers are clashing.

3. Decide how to handle each mismatch
	1.	Token-embed or lm_head weight mismatches
If the vocab size is off (e.g. you loaded the wrong tokenizer), do

model.resize_token_embeddings(len(tokenizer))

before loading any weights.

	2.	Completely incompatible heads
If it’s your classification head (e.g. it’s expecting a 1024→2 weight but the checkpoint has 4096→2), you have two options:
	•	Remove those keys and initialize a fresh head:

state = ckpt.copy()
for k in list(state):
    if k.startswith("classifier"):
        state.pop(k)
model.load_state_dict(state, strict=False)


	•	Or re-fine-tune your head from scratch on your detection data.

	3.	Unexpected missing keys
If the checkpoint simply doesn’t have keys your model expects, that means the checkpoint was never fine-tuned for that architecture. You’ll need a “real” checkpoint for that model.

⸻

4. If you really need to “ignore mismatches”

You can instruct HF to drop any size-mismatched weights automatically:

model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
    detector_id,
    ignore_mismatched_sizes=True,
    torch_dtype=torch.float16
)

But after that you must check model.state_dict() for randomly initialized layers (they’ll be your new heads) and—if you depend on them—fine-tune those before you trust the outputs.

⸻

TL;DR
	1.	Don’t point a RoBERTa-based detector at a Vicuna (LLaMA) checkpoint.
	2.	Inspect your pytorch_model.bin vs. the model’s state_dict() to see exactly which layers are off.
	3.	Either remove the bad keys and accept a freshly-initialized head or re-obtain a correctly fine-tuned checkpoint.

Getting familiar with the HF state_dict and config.json behind each model is the fastest way to resolve these loading errors. Let me know if you hit a specific layer mismatch and want help drilling into it!
