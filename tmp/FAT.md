FAT!!!
Install AttifyOS v3 // v4

AttifyOS 4 ships Firmware Analysis Toolkit (FAT) as an LXD container, which in turn drives Firmadyne under the hood, so you can absolutely point it at a consumer-router firmware blob and spin up a full QEMU emulation of your target device.

**How it works in AttifyOS 4.0:**

1. **FAT as a container**
   AttifyOS bundles FAT inside an LXD container (instead of requiring you to install Python 2/3, Binwalk, Firmadyne, etc., by hand).
2. **Architecture coverage**
   Firmadyne (and thus FAT) supports the most common router SoC ISAs—MIPS (big- and little-endian), ARM (armel/armhf), PowerPC, etc.—so nearly any Linksys, D-Link, Netgear, TP-Link, etc., image can be emulated.
3. **Network bridging**
   FAT will automatically create host-only or bridged `br0`, `br1` interfaces and assign IPs so that, once the emulated firmware boots, you can ping or HTTP into its web-UI just like the real device.

### Quick start on AttifyOS 4

1. **Import the OVA** (or install from ISO), then log in as `attify`/`attify`.
2. **Launch the FAT container**

   ```bash
   # see the container name (e.g. 'fat')
   lxc list
   # drop into the container’s shell
   lxc exec fat -- /bin/bash
   ```
3. **Feed it your router firmware**

   ```bash
   # inside the container; replace with your firmware file
   ./fat.py ~/firmware/NETGEAR_R7000-V1.0.9.88_1.0.30.zip
   ```
4. **Choose QEMU version if needed**
   If you run into kernel/QEMU mismatches on ARM images, re-run with:

   ```bash
   ./fat.py --qemu 2.5.0 your_firmware.bin
   ```
5. **Boot and test**
   Once it shows you something like:

   ```
   [+] Network interfaces: [('br0','192.168.0.2')]
   [+] All set! Press ENTER to run the firmware…
   ```

   hit ENTER, then from your host:

   ```bash
   ping 192.168.0.2
   # or
   curl http://192.168.0.2
   ```

---

### Caveats & tips

* **Sandbox it** – always run in a VM or isolated host-only network.
* **Firmware quirks** – encrypted or very recent Broadcom/Qualcomm firmwares sometimes need manual partition tweaks in the container.
* **Resource caps** – give your AttifyOS VM at least 4 CPU cores and 4 GB RAM for smooth QEMU emulation.

In practice, nearly every consumer-router image you’ll grab from a vendor site will boot under FAT on AttifyOS 4 – so go ahead and point it at your `.BIN` or `.IMG` and you’ll have a live emulated console in minutes.



1. **Install and initialize LXD**

   ```bash
   sudo snap install lxd                 # grabs the latest LXD snap  
   sudo lxd init                         # accept defaults or tweak storage/network  
   ```

   This gives you the `lxc` client and daemon for launching lightweight Ubuntu containers ([Canonical][1]).

2. **Launch an Ubuntu container**

   ```bash
   lxc launch images:ubuntu/18.04 fat     # Firmadyne/FAT works best on 18.04  
   lxc exec fat -- bash                   # drop into the container shell  
   ```

   (You can also use 20.04, but you’ll need the FAT binwalk patch – 18.04 is the path of least resistance.) ([GitHub][2])

3. **Inside the container: install prerequisites**

   ```bash
   apt update
   apt install -y python2.7 python3 git binwalk qemu-system-mips        \
                  qemu-system-arm build-essential liblzma-dev unzip
   ```

4. **Clone and set up FAT**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/attify/firmware-analysis-toolkit.git
   cd firmware-analysis-toolkit
   ./setup.sh                     # this will pull in Firmadyne, QEMU builds, etc.
   ```

5. **Run your firmware**

   ```bash
   ./fat.py /path/to/your_router_firmware.bin
   # hit ENTER when it finishes setup, then from your host:
   ping <emulated-IP>  # or curl http://<emulated-IP>
   ```

**Key points:**

* You’re effectively recreating the “FAT as an LXD container” approach that AttifyOS uses under the hood ([GitHub][2]).
* Running in a container on Ubuntu 22.04 keeps your host clean, isolates network bridges, and avoids dependency clashes.
* If you hit an ARM-kernel/QEMU mismatch, re-run FAT with `--qemu 2.5.0` to force the older, compatible QEMU build.

With those steps, Ubuntu 22 + LXD gives you the exact same container-based FAT experience that comes pre-installed on AttifyOS.

Usage: 

1. **Download the vendor’s firmware image** (e.g. `TP-Link_ARCHER-A7-V5_3.17.1_UP_BOOT(230415).bin`).
2. **Copy it into your container** (either via `lxc file push firmware.bin fat/home/attify/` or by mounting a host directory).
3. **Inside the container** run:

   ```bash
   cd /home/attify/firmware-analysis-toolkit
   ./fat.py firmware.bin
   ```
4. **Hit ENTER** when prompted—FAT will spin up a QEMU VM, detect the architecture, build the disk, and show you the emulated device’s IP.
5. From your **host**, simply `ping` or `curl` that IP and you’re live in the router’s UI.

In practice, **most** stock consumer-router blobs (MIPS, ARM, etc.) just “work” out of the box. The only times you’ll need extra tweaks are when:

* The vendor uses a **proprietary/obfuscated** filesystem layout (you may need to manually extract with Binwalk first).
* It’s encrypted or signed—in which case you’d have to strip the header or use the vendor’s recovery tools to unpack it.
* You hit a **QEMU-kernel mismatch** on ARM firmwares—just rerun with `--qemu 2.5.0` to force the older QEMU build.

Otherwise, download → drop in container → `./fat.py` → emulate: no question, no problem.


Troubleshooting: 

Here are some common gotchas and extra commands you can use when your FAT/Firmadyne emulation isn’t quite “plug-and-play”:

---

## 1. Verify your container/tooling environment

```bash
# Are you actually in the ‘fat’ container?
lxc list                              # look for your container’s name & status
lxc exec fat -- whoami                # should return ‘root’ or the user you expect

# Do you have the right Python/QEMU/binwalk versions?
lxc exec fat -- python2 --version
lxc exec fat -- python3 --version
lxc exec fat -- binwalk --version
lxc exec fat -- qemu-system-mips --version
lxc exec fat -- qemu-system-arm --version
```

---

## 2. Firmware extraction hiccups

* **Manual Binwalk carve**
  If `./fat.py` stalls at “Extracting the firmware…”, try unpacking by hand:

  ```bash
  binwalk -Me firmware.bin         # “-M” for recursive, “-e” for extract
  cd _firmware.bin.extracted/
  ```
* **Offset mounts**
  Some firmwares pack squashfs or cramfs with a non-zero offset. Identify it:

  ```bash
  binwalk firmware.bin
  # note the offset in bytes, then:
  sudo mount -o loop,ro,offset=$((0xOFFSET)) firmware.bin /mnt
  ```

---

## 3. QEMU emulation troubleshooting

* **Force a specific QEMU build**
  ARM kernels in Firmadyne sometimes require the older 2.5.0:

  ```bash
  ./fat.py --qemu 2.5.0 firmware.bin
  ```
* **Run the raw runner script**
  After FAT sets up everything, it invokes `run.$ARCH.sh`.  To see consoles & logs live:

  ```bash
  cd firmadyne/           # or wherever your images are
  ./run.mipseb.sh 1       # (replace with your ARCH & image ID)
  ```
* **Serial console output**
  If the GUI window vanishes, try `-nographic` in the runner or patch `firmadyne.config` to add:

  ```
  FIRMADYNE_QEMU_ARGS="-nographic -serial mon:stdio"
  ```

---

## 4. Networking woes

* **No IP on br0/br1?**

  * Increase inferNetwork timeout in `scripts/inferNetwork.sh`:

    ```bash
    sed -i 's/timeout --preserve-status --signal SIGINT 60/timeout --preserve-status --signal SIGINT 120/' scripts/inferNetwork.sh
    ```
  * Verify with:

    ```bash
    ip link show
    brctl show
    ip addr show br0
    ```
* **Manually assign**
  If DHCP fails, drop into the container host and:

  ```bash
  sudo ip addr add 192.168.0.2/24 dev br0
  sudo ip link set br0 up
  ping 192.168.0.1
  ```

---

## 5. Dependency & Ubuntu version issues

* **Ubuntu 20.04 binwalk bug**
  If you see Python2 syntax errors in Binwalk’s install, apply the upstream patch from FAT’s repo or stick to Ubuntu 18.04 containers.
* **Missing kernel headers**
  QEMU sometimes needs headers for certain architectures:

  ```bash
  apt install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
  ```

---

## 6. General debug tips

* **Verbose mode**

  ```bash
  ./fat.py -h       # shows flags & debug options
  ```
* **Inspect logs**
  Many of the Firmadyne scripts log to `firmadyne/log/`. Tail them:

  ```bash
  tail -F firmadyne/log/*.log
  ```
* **Strace the failure**
  If a script is crashing early, run it under strace inside the container:

  ```bash
  strace -f -o /tmp/fat-strace.log ./fat.py firmware.bin
  ```

With these extra steps and commands you’ll be better equipped to diagnose unpacking errors, QEMU mismatches, network bridge failures, or dependency issues—and get your router firmware up and running under emulation.
